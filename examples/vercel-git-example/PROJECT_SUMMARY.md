# Vercel Git Explorer - Project Summary

## Overview

The Vercel Git Explorer is a specialized demonstration of the Lightfast Computer SDK's Vercel Sandbox provider, focused specifically on git repository exploration and visualization. This Next.js application serves as THE reference implementation for building git-focused tools using Vercel Sandbox.

## Key Features

### 1. Git-Aware File Explorer (`src/components/git/GitFileExplorer.tsx`)
- **Git Status Integration**: Files show visual indicators for modified, added, deleted, and untracked states
- **Branch Awareness**: Current branch displayed with change indicators
- **Smart Navigation**: Repository-aware directory traversal
- **Binary File Detection**: Prevents displaying binary files as text

### 2. Commit History Viewer (`src/components/git/GitHistory.tsx`)
- **Rich Commit Display**: Shows hash, message, author, and relative time
- **Detailed View**: Click commits to see full diff and statistics
- **Branch Context**: Always shows which branch you're viewing
- **Performance**: Loads last 30 commits by default

### 3. Branch Management (`src/components/git/GitBranchSelector.tsx`)
- **Branch Listing**: Shows both local and remote branches
- **Safe Switching**: Checks for uncommitted changes before switching
- **Visual Indicators**: Current branch highlighted, remote branches marked
- **One-Click Checkout**: Switch branches with a single click

### 4. Repository Status Panel (`src/components/git/GitStatusPanel.tsx`)
- **Real-Time Status**: Shows working tree state
- **File Change List**: Categorized by staged/unstaged status
- **Sync Status**: Shows ahead/behind counts with upstream
- **Clean State Indicator**: Visual confirmation when working tree is clean

### 5. Enhanced Terminal (`src/components/command-terminal.tsx`)
- **Git Command Library**: Pre-configured common git commands
- **Smart Suggestions**: Context-aware command recommendations
- **Categorized Commands**: Organized by operation type (info, branch, history, etc.)
- **Visual Output**: Properly formatted git command results

## Technical Architecture

### API Design
- **Centralized Git Endpoint**: `/api/git/route.ts` handles all git operations
- **Operation-Based**: Uses operation parameter to determine git command
- **Smart Parsing**: Automatically parses git output into structured data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of git errors with user-friendly messages

### Component Structure
```
src/components/git/
├── GitFileExplorer.tsx     # Main file browser with git integration
├── GitHistory.tsx          # Commit history viewer
├── GitBranchSelector.tsx   # Branch management UI
└── GitStatusPanel.tsx      # Repository status display
```

### Utilities
- **git-utils.ts**: Common git commands, status parsing, file type detection
- **Command Categories**: Organized by info, branch, commit, history, remote

## User Experience Enhancements

### 1. Git-First Navigation
- Default to git file explorer when selecting an instance
- Tabs organized by git workflow (files → history → branches)
- Visual git indicators throughout the UI

### 2. Repository Examples
- Pre-filled popular repositories (Next.js, React, Vue)
- One-click population of repository URLs
- Clear indication of git capabilities

### 3. Educational Elements
- Tooltips explaining git concepts
- Command descriptions in quick commands
- Status explanations in panels

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of file contents
- Debounced git status checks
- Cached branch information
- Limited commit history by default

## Integration Points

### With Lightfast Computer SDK
```typescript
// All git operations go through standard command execution
const result = await computer.commands.execute({
  instanceId,
  command: `git ${operation} ${args}`
});
```

### With Vercel Sandbox
- Leverages sandbox's git pre-installation
- Uses sandbox file system for repository storage
- Executes git commands through sandbox runtime

## Security Considerations

1. **Command Sanitization**: All git commands are constructed server-side
2. **Path Validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
3. **Public Repos Only**: No credential handling for private repos
4. **Read-Only Operations**: Focuses on exploration, not modification

## Future Enhancements

1. **Git Diff Viewer**: Side-by-side diff visualization
2. **Blame View**: Line-by-line authorship information
3. **Graph Visualization**: Visual branch/merge history
4. **Search Integration**: Search across commits and file history
5. **Multi-Repo Support**: Compare multiple repositories

## Development Notes

### Testing Git Features
1. Create sandbox with a git repository URL
2. Navigate to "Repository Files" tab
3. Check git status indicators on files
4. Switch to "Commit History" to browse commits
5. Use "Branches & Status" to switch branches
6. Execute git commands in Terminal

### Common Issues
- Large repositories may take time to clone
- Binary files show as "[Binary file - cannot display]"
- Branch switching requires clean working tree
- Some git operations may timeout on very large repos

## Comparison with flyio-git-example

While both examples focus on git, they serve different purposes:
- **vercel-git-example**: Comprehensive git exploration with rich UI
- **flyio-git-example**: Simpler implementation, focuses on basic git operations

This Vercel example provides the more advanced, production-ready git integration.
